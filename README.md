### Presentation
Only a playground to test differents things around ruby-sinatra and many other techy.

At this moment, stuff that I'm playing with in this project:

- Ruby
- Sinatra
- Haml
- Datamapper
- Bootstrap (+bootwatch theming)
- Backbone.js (not yet pushed)
- And anything that I want to include some morning to sandbox' it!

Finally, when I'll be almost satisfied of the core app structure, I will release a real mvc starter kit for Sinatra. Many good starter can be found, but after tried some I was always missing something, so without any pretention I'm just working to get a solid base to share with other sinatra-lover :P

### Concept
- Machine  
- Product  
- Product can be a finished one, raw material, component, etc.  
- Product can be made of any other product = Part  
- Product can me handled by one or many machine = Process  
- Process can be simulated... finally we got our simulation! :) 

### Architecture
Application wrapped into a Ruby Sinatra framework, organized as MVC. This is too early to explain more, this could change a lot so that's it for now!

### Todos
- Integrate simulation engine  
- Have a useful dashboard page (Display something interesting!)
- Fill the custom settings page  
- Be able to create account and company  

### Issues
Hopefully, nothing for now
