Only a playground to test differents things around ruby-sinatra and many other techy.

At this moment, stuff that I'm playing with in this project:

- Ruby
- Sinatra
- Haml
- Datamapper
- Bootstrap (+bootwatch theming)
- Backbone.js (not yet pushed)
- And anything that I want to include some morning to sandbox' it!

Finally, when I'll be almost satisfied of the core app structure, I will release a real mvc starter kit for Sinatra. Many good starter can be found, but after tried some I was always missing something, so without any pretention I'm just working to get a solid base to share with other sinatra-lover :P
